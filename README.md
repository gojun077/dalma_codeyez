`dalma_codeyez` is a program to keep track of how many problems
you have solved on the following programming challenge sites:

- Codewars
- Leetcode
- Project Euler

All 3 sites have publicly accessible endpoints which give information
about how many problems have been solved by a user.

## Roadmap

- `v0.1` initial version with naive problem counts, public API only
- `v0.2` support cookie login for privileged pages, add DB backend
